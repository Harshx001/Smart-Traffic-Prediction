# 🚦 Smart Traffic Congestion Prediction Model

## 📌 Overview

The **Smart Traffic Congestion Prediction Model** is an end-to-end data science project built to predict traffic congestion levels using historical data, weather conditions, and time-based features. The model can be used by transport authorities, smart city planners, and navigation services to forecast traffic in real-time and reduce congestion with smarter decision-making.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion is a growing issue worldwide, especially during peak hours and adverse weather conditions. This project aims to provide an ML-based predictive model that:
- Forecasts congestion level for given conditions
- Identifies peak congestion periods and zones
- Enhances city-wide transport optimization

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw traffic datasets
- Engineer features from timestamps, weather, and location data
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models to predict congestion
- Visualize patterns with Power BI, heatmaps, and boxplots
- Provide actionable insights through dashboards
